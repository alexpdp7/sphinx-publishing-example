Experiment using sphinx for publishing

Use:

$ make latexpdf  # to generate PDF with LaTeX; you will need a LaTeX
                 # environment; on Debian, install texlive-latex-extra
$ make epub      # to generate an EPUB
$ make html      # to publish HTML

To generate graphviz graphs you will need dot, included in the Debian
graphviz package.
