Example with math
=================

We can handle simple equations such as:

.. math:: e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0

Which unifies classics such as :math:`e`, :math:`i`, :math:`\pi`, :math:`1` and :math:`0`.

We can also do assignment simply:

.. math::

   (a + b)^2  &=  (a + b)(a + b) \\
              &=  a^2 + 2ab + b^2
